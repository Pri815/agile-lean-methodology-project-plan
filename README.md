# Project Plan (Agile + Lean Methodology)

This repository contains a project plan I created while practicing **Agile** and **Lean** methodologies.  
The plan includes:  
- Project scope and objectives  
- Agile sprint planning  
- Kanban board structure  
- Lean prioritization techniques  
- Risk and dependency management  

## Methodologies Used
- **Agile**: Iterative development, sprints, backlog grooming  
- **Lean**: Value stream mapping, waste reduction, continuous improvement  

## Deliverables
- Project plan document (see `/docs`)  
- Example backlog and sprint board  
- Process flow diagrams
